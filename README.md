<img src="https://blog.golang.org/go-brand/Go-Logo/PNG/Go-Logo_Blue.png" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle"/> I’m diving into Go, no sleep in sight,  
Fingers on keys all through the night.  
Loops and structs, I’ll learn them all,  
But your smile? That’s the biggest call.  

My code might crash, my brain might cry,  
Yet thoughts of you keep me high.  
So while I’m chasing Go’s sweet quest,  
You’ve already hacked into my chest.
